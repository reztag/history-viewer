## What it does
- Simple and minimal interface that allows you to view your browsing history in a better way.

- Allows to search keywords or domain for finding related history.
- Sorting by Oldest or Newest occurence of browsing history.
- Ability to favorite a history event for future reference.
- Allows to jump to a specific date to view its history.

## Why I made this extension?
I never really liked my Chrome browser's history page because I require to navigate my browsing history a lot when I research into a rabbit hole my way haha. At many times the inbuilt history page failed to deliver a valid search result even. And there is NO date picker feature. Bookmarks exist but they won't save the history timestamp so that I could jump to that date and analyse my journey.
So, I tried my best with current knowledge to make an extension which does my work. I learned a lot about Manifest and the entire extension making in the process.
