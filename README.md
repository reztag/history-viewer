## Why I made this extension?
I never really liked my Chrome browser's history page because I require to navigate my browsing history a lot when I research into a rabbit hole my way haha. At many times the inbuilt history page failed to deliver a valid search result even. And there is NO date picker feature. Bookmarks exist but they won't save the history timestamp so that I could jump to that date and analyse my journey.
So, I tried my best with current knowledge to make an extension which does my work, I learned a lot about Manifest and the entire extension making in the process.

## Features
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Easily filter and search your history by date, keyword, website, or even by specific URLs.
- **Simple Interface**: A simple and minimal layout helps to quickly overview history.
